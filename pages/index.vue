    <p>
      <b>Hello!</b> My name is Daniel Balastegui and I am a software engineer
      with a special love for web technologies.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      These last years I developed a predilection for JavaScript, being my main
      language and interest right now.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I consider myself a rigorous and restless person, always learning and
      trying to improve my skills while doing projects.
      <a href="mailto:dbalasdev@gmail.com">Â¿Do you have any suggestion?</a>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Outside of computer science and raise my kid together with my wife, I
      enjoy video games, cinema and reading.
